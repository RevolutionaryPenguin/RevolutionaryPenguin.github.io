            Hi! I am Tean Chandler. I have 4 sibilings. I live near Pocatello Idaho. I'm 13 turning 14. I have played the Piano for 6 years, the ukulele for 1 year and I recently started the guitar. I do coding, riding horses, read, anything outdoors, hanging out with friends, and I like skiing. My favorite color changes between yellow and orange. I like most sports football, soccer, basketball, baseball, pickleball, and tennis. I have done coding competitions and usually place in the top 25 out of 5000. My best placement so far is 5th.
